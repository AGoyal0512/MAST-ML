output_data.csv:
    Output data, consisting of:
    Labeling features columns, if any
    Input features columns
    Target prediction column
statistics.txt:
    Statistics for the fit.
    No statistics were collected because there
        was no measured data (target feature data)
        in the testing dataset.
    For this reason, there is also no plot of
        predicted vs. measured data.
