----- Folder contents -----
single_fit
    Folder containing a single overall fit.
<group> folders
    Individual group fits, training on
        a single group and testing on
        a single group.
    Only groups that appear in both the
        training data and the testing data
        have their own folder.
Overlayed plot folders would have appeared,
    but there is no testing data to plot.
