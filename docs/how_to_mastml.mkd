% How To Mastml

MASTML is written in a fairly modular way, to allow new
sections and subsections to be added without too great of a headache.

There are several places where we have had to _cheat_ and break some of the
rules, but the overall program flow is fairly sensible.

![The structure of do\_combos, I will reference this later](structure.svg)

## `mastml.py`

This is the main entry point to the program, both through the command line or
if calling from within python.  `main` can be called directly with the
appropriate file path, or mastml can be invoked from the command line using

`python -m mastml.mastml foo.conf bar.csv -o results/foobar`

`main` takes in paths to files, relative to your current working directory. If
you need to call mastml without creating files on disk, you need to either
create a `tmp` file (fairly easy) or modify the program to take in file
objects/strings instead (small hassle).

`main` calls `utils.activate_logging` which splits logging across `log.log` and
`errors.log` in `outdir`, as well as printing them to screen. Lower verbosity
causes less to be printed to screen, but does not affect log files.

`mastml_run` is then called inside of a try-catch block, which treats mastml
specific errors differently than errors from other libraries.

#### Conf File Parsing

`mastml_run` calls `conf_parser.parse_conf_file` to convert the conf file into
a conf dict. Notice how these two lines:

```python
PlotSettings = conf['PlotSettings']
is_classification = conf['is_classification']
```

pull two program globals out of the conf dict. All other contents of the conf
dict are used as arguments in other functions. 

#### Data Loading

Here is how we get the entire
input csv, input features, and target features from csv file, saved into pandas
dataframes:

```python
df, X, y = data_loader.load_data(data_path,
                                 conf['GeneralSetup']['input_features'],
                                 conf['GeneralSetup']['target_feature'])
```

It's important that `conf` is never passed in it's entirety to anyone who
doesn't need to see it, based in the
[principle of least privilege](http://wiki.c2.com/?PrincipleOfLeastPrivilege).

#### Section Instantiation

Next we get all the instantiation of all of the objects needed to do the
mastml run. This used to look like this before "model snatcher" was added in:
```python
models      = _instantiate(conf['Models'],
                           model_finder.name_to_constructor,
                           'model')
generators  = _instantiate(conf['FeatureGeneration'],
                           feature_generators.name_to_constructor,
                           'featuregenerator')
clusterers  = _instantiate(conf['Clustering'],
                           legos_clusterers.name_to_constructor,
                           'clusterer')
normalizers = _instantiate(conf['FeatureNormalization'],
                           feature_normalizers.name_to_constructor,
                           'featurenormalizer')
selectors   = _instantiate(conf['FeatureSelection'],
                           feature_selectors.name_to_constructor,
                           'featureselector')
splitters   = _instantiate(conf['DataSplits'],
                           data_splitters.name_to_constructor,
                           'datasplit')
```


#### Model Snatcher

Models are instantiated early and passed into feature
selection and learning curve, as specified in those sections. This way, a
subsection can reference a model by name and get its instance and all of its
parameters.

```python
models = _instantiate(conf['Models'],
                      model_finder.name_to_constructor,
                      'model')
models = OrderedDict(models) # for easier modification
_snatch_models(models, conf['FeatureSelection'])
if conf['PlotSettings']['data_learning_curve']:
    name = conf['GeneralSetup']['learning_curve_model']
    conf['GeneralSetup']['learning_curve_model'] = models[name]
    del models[name]
models = list(models.items())
...
```
