Materials Simulation Toolkit for Machine Learning (MAST-ML)

MAST-ML is an open-source Python package designed to broaden and accelerate the use of machine learning in materials science research

As of MAST-ML version 3.x, much of the original code and workflow have been rewritten. The use of an input file in version 2.x and older
has been removed in favor of a more modular Jupyter notebook computing environment. Please see the examples and tutorials under
the mastml/examples folder for a guide in using MAST-ML
