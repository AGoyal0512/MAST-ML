**Feature**: A feature of an observation or sample. Here, corresponds to a column. For example, Copper content of all samples.
 
**Target feature**: The feature to be predicted. For example, plate thickness, or alloy hardness.
 
**Target error feature**: data on the ucertainty of the “target feature” data. It is used to create error bars on Prediction vs Calculated plots. This is currently required to be set so if this is unkown it can be set as any sufficiently small feature or set as an all zeros column if starting from a csv file.
